Students Performance Analysis
This project is a Python script designed to analyze and visualize student performance data from the StudentsPerformance.csv file. It provides insights into how various factors like gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation courses influence students' test scores.

Features
Data Cleaning: Standardizes column names, handles missing values, and calculates an average score for each student.
Visualizations:
Average Scores by Gender: Bar chart comparing performance between male and female students.
Impact of Parental Education: Box plot showing test scores based on the parental level of education.
Math Scores Distribution by Lunch Type: Histogram visualizing the effect of lunch type on math scores.
Test Preparation Course Impact: Box plot analyzing how test preparation courses influence average scores.
Performance by Race/Ethnicity: Box plot displaying average scores across different racial/ethnic groups.
Sample Data
Here’s a snapshot of the dataset used in the analysis:

gender	race/ethnicity	parental level of education	lunch	test preparation course	math score	reading score	writing score
female	group B	bachelor's degree	standard	none	72	72	74
male	group A	associate's degree	free/reduced	none	47	57	44
female	group C	some college	standard	completed	69	90	88
